# RequireTS TypeScript

RequireTS TypeScript files well more modules. It
optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used
in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and
[Node] It implements the
[Asynchronous Module].

RequireTS uses plain script tags to load modules or files, so it should allow for
easy debugging. It can be used
[simply to load existing TypeScript files]
so you can add it to your existing project without having to re-write your
JavaScript files.
